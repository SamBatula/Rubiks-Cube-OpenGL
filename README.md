# Description

Rubiks Cube Simulator is a simulator created in XCode, using the OpenGL API for things such as lighting, particles, collision detection, Bitmap Strings, Idle animation functions, and Timer animation functions.

Rubiks Cube Simulator is a simulator where users are able to practice solving a 3x3 rubiks cube virtually. Lights, animation, materials, particles, and more were used to create this Simulation. As of now, the logic to solve the cube (Rotate the faces of the cube) isn't implemented. This is a side project and I will be adding the logic to solve the cube within the next 2-3 months. Happy you're here for the journey!

# Language
